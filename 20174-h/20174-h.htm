<p class="quote">
    "He owns only his mental vision. But this is clear and broad of
    range&mdash;as broad, indeed, as that of Dante, Milton and Goethe,
    sweeping beyond the horizon of eschatology and mounting, like
    Francis Thompson's, even to the Throne of Grace itself when the
    theme demands reverential daring."

<h2>
    THE QUALITY OF THE WORKS OF EDWARD DOYLE
</h2>

<img src="images/ill-007b.png" style="width: 90px; height: 105px; float:left; padding:0; margin-right:1em;"
alt="" />
<p style="text-indent: -1em;">
<span style="display:none;">T</span>he quality of Edward Doyle's work was appraised by Ella Wheeler Wilcox
in the following article by Mrs. Wilcox which appeared in the New York
Evening Journal and the San Francisco <i>Examiner</i>, in 1905:
</p>
<p>
Shut your eyes and bind them with a black cloth and try for one hour to
see how cheerful you can be. Then imagine yourself deprived for life of
the light of day.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps this experiment will make you less rebellious with your present
lot.
</p>
<p>
Then take the little book called "The Haunted Temple and Other Poems,"
by Edward Doyle, the blind poet of Harlem, and read and wonder and feel
ashamed of any mood of distrust of God and discontent with life you have
ever indulged.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Doyle has been blind for the last thirty-seven years; he has lived
a half century.
</p>
<p>
Therefore he still remembers the privilege of seeing God's world when
a lad, and this must augment rather than ameliorate his sorrow.
</p>
<p>
He who has never known the use of eyes cannot fully understand the
immensity of the loss of sight.
</p>
<p>
I hear people in possession of all their senses, and with many
blessings, bewail the fact that they were ever born.
</p>
<p>
They have missed some aim, failed of some cherished ambition, lost some
special joy or been defeated in some purpose.
</p>
<h3>
A GREAT SOUL
</h3>
<p>
And so they sit in spiritual darkness and curse life and doubt God. But
here is a great soul who has found his divine self in the darkness and
who sends out this wonderful song of joy and gratitude.
</p>
<p>
Read it, oh, ye weak repiners, and read it again and again. It is
beautiful in thought, perfect in expression and glorious with truth.

<h3>
CHIME, DARK BELL
</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   My life is in deep darkness; still, I cry, </p>
<p class="i4">     With joy to my Creator, "It is well!" </p>
<p class="i4">     Were worlds my words, what firmaments would tell </p>
<p class="i2">   My transport at the consciousness that I </p>
<p class="i2">   Who was not, Am! To be&mdash;oh, that is why </p>
<p class="i4">     The awful convex dark in which I dwell </p>
<p class="i4">     Is tongued with joy, and chimes a temple bell. </p>
<p class="i2">   Antiphonally to the choirs on high! </p>
<p class="i2">   Chime cheerily, dark bell! for were no more </p>
<p class="i4">     Than consciousness my gift, this were to know </p>
<p class="i2">   The Giver Good&mdash;which sums up all the lore </p>
<p class="i4">     Eternity can possibly bestow. </p>
<p class="i2">   Chime! for thy metal is the molten ore </p>
<p class="i4">     Of the great stars, and marks no wreck below. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
I know a gifted and brilliant man in New York who is full of charm and
wit in conversation, but the moment he touches a pen he becomes, as a
rule, a melancholy pessimist, crying out at the injustice of the world
and the uselessness of high endeavor in the field of art.
</p>
<p>
When urged to take a different mental attitude for the sake of the
reading world, which needs strong tonics of hope and courage, rather
than the slow poison of pessimism, however subtly sweet the brew, my
friend responds that "The song and dance of literature is not my special
gift." And he is obliged to "speak of the world as I find it."
</p>
<p>
He is an able-bodied man, in the prime of life, with splendid years
waiting on his threshold to lead him to any height he may wish to climb.
But to his mental vision, nothing is really "worth while."
</p>
<p>
What a rebuke this wonderful poem of Edward Doyle's should be to all
such men and women. What an inspiration it should be to every mortal who
reads it, to look within, and find the <b>Kingdom of God</b> as this
blind poet has found it.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Doyle was in St. Francis Xavier's College when his great affliction
fell upon him. He started a local paper, The Advocate, in Harlem
twenty-three years ago and has in the darkness of his physical vision
developed his poetical talent and given the world some great lines.
</p>
<h3>
AN INSPIRATION
</h3>
<p>
Here is a poem which throbs with the keen anguish which must have been
his guest through many silent hours of these thirty-seven years:
</p>
<h3>
TO A CHILD READING
</h3>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   My darling, spell the words out. You may creep </p>
<p class="i4">     Across the syllables on hands and knees, </p>
<p class="i4">     And stumble often, yet pass me with ease </p>
<p class="i2">   And reach the spring upon the summit steep. </p>
<p class="i2">   Oh, I could lay me down, dear child, and weep </p>
<p class="i4">     These charr'd orbs out, but that you then might cease </p>
<p class="i4">     Your upward effort, and with inquiries </p>
<p class="i2">   Stoop down and probe my heart too deep, too deep! </p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

<p class="i2">   I thirst for Knowledge. Oh, for an endless drink </p>
<p class="i4">     Your goblet leaks the whole way from the spring&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   No matter, to its rim a few drops cling, </p>
<p class="i2">   And these refresh me with the joy to think </p>
<p class="i4">     That you, my darling, have the morning's wing </p>
<p class="i2">   To cross the mountain at whose base I sink. </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
But Edward Doyle has not sunk "at the mountain's base." He is far up its
summit, and he will go higher. He has found God, and nothing can hinder
his flight. He is an inspiration to all struggling, toiling souls on
earth.
</p>
<p>
As I read his book, with its strong clarion cry of faith and joy and
courage, and ponder over the carefully finished thoughts and beautifully
polished lines, I feel ashamed of my own small achievements, and am
inspired to new efforts.
</p>
<p>
Glory and success to you, Edward Doyle.

<h3>
THE JEWS IN RUSSIA
</h3>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   From town and village to a wood, stript bare, </p>
<p class="i2">   As they of their possessions, see them throng. </p>
<p class="i2">   Above them grows a cloud; it moves along, </p>
<p class="i2">   As flee they from the circling wolf pack's glare. </p>
<p class="i2">   Is it their Brocken-Shadow of despair, </p>
<p class="i2">   The looming of their life of cruel wrong </p>
<p class="i2">   For countless ages? No; their faith is strong </p>
<p class="i2">   In their Jehovah; that huge cloud is prayer. </p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   A flash of light, and black the despot lies. </p>
<p class="i2">   What thunder round the world! 'Tis transport's strain </p>
<p class="i2">   Proclaiming loud:  "No righteous prayer is vain </p>
<p class="i2">   No God-imploring tears are lost; they rise </p>
<p class="i2">   Into a cloud, and in the sky remain </p>
<p class="i2">   Till they draw lightening from Jehovah's eyes." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
The author of this superb little gem, like Homer, is blind; but, like
Homer, his mental vision is clear, and broad, and deep. President
Schurman, of Cornell University, commenting on Doyle once said: "It is
as true today as of yore that the genuine poet, even though blind,
is the Seer and Prophet of his generation." The poem here printed
illustrates the point. Did we not know that it was published some
fifteen years ago in a volume entitled

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span>

                                        "The Haunted Temple," we should
assume that it was written on the occasion of the fall of the Czar. In
fact, however, it merely foretells this event by some dozen years. And
how terribly applicable are the lines to the facts of today! The
prophecy is one capable of repeated fulfillment.
</p>
<p>
But it is as a prophet of nationalism that this man compels our
particular attention. The prophecy is embodied in a play entitled "The
Comet, a Play of Our Times," brought out as far back as 1908. The play
is a microcosm of American life. The chief character is a college
president, and he it is that is chosen to expound the true nature of
nationalism and to give voice and utterance to the principle of
self-determination. (Is it merely a coincidence that at that time
Woodrow Wilson was President of Princeton, or is it a case of poetic
vision. Wilson, be it remembered, was already a national figure, and
there were already glimmerings that he was destined to usher in a new
era in politics.) According to the protagonist, America is not "a
boiling cauldron in which the elements seethe, but never settle," but
rather a college where every class is taught to translate&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">  "Into the common speech of daily life</p>
<p class="i2">  The country's loftiest ideals&mdash;"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-indent: 0;">
and any body of citizens form a part of our republic only in so far&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "As they contribute to its character </p>
<p class="i2">   As leader of the nations unto Right </p>
<p class="i2">   By thought or deed, in service for mankind." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
We must lead the peoples of the world to freedom. And what is freedom?
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "'Tis intelligence </p>
<p class="i2">   Aloof from harm and hamper, grandly circling </p>
<p class="i2">   Its native sun-lit peaks, the highest hopes </p>
<p class="i2">   Heaved from the heart of man upon the earth, </p>
<p class="i2">   In ranges long as time and soul endure." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
What, then, is America's duty to the oppressed race or the small nation?
It is to "wake and disabuse it of false hope"&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i24">                         "and urge it on </p>
<p class="i2">   To the development of its own powers, </p>
<p class="i2">   The culmination of its own ideals, </p>
<p class="i2">   The star seed sown by God,&mdash;the only means </p>
<p class="i2">   By which a tribe can thrive to its perfection." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
To make this possible, civilization must be given a more human content.
It is therefore necessary to awake human intelligence, "the godlike
genius," to a realization of the fact&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">                         "&mdash;that, on having brought </p>
<p class="i2">   This world from out the chaos dark </p>
<p class="i2">   Of waters and of woody wilderness, </p>
<p class="i2">   And shaped it into hills of hope for man, </p>
<p class="i2">   Must providence its beautiful creation </p>
<p class="i2">   With altruistic love and tenderness; </p>
<p class="i2">   So that all tribes of man, what'er their hue, </p>
<p class="i2">   Have each a hill where it can touch the star </p>
<p class="i2">   That it has followed with its mental growth." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span>
</p>
<p>
Such a program is rendered imperative by the inexorability of the law
of race, which nullifies any attempts to force assimilation:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "It is a foolish, futile thing </p>
<p class="i2">   To try to shape society by codes, </p>
<p class="i2">   Vetoed by Nature. Nature trumpets forth </p>
<p class="i2">   No edict, through the instinct of a race, </p>
<p class="i2">   Proclaiming certain territory hers </p>
<p class="i2">   And warning all encroaching powers therefrom, </p>
<p class="i2">   Without the ordering out of her reserves </p>
<p class="i2">   To see to it the edict is enforced. </p>
<p class="i2">   Let politics keep off forbidden shores." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
If any powers preserve in a policy of oppression, our duty is plain:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "To teach the barbarous tribes throughout the globe, </p>
<p class="i2">   Christian or Turk, that all humanity </p>
<p class="i2">   Is territory sheltered by our flag; </p>
<p class="i2">   That butchery must cease throughout the world; </p>
<p class="i2">   That, having ended human slavery, </p>
<p class="i2">   Old glory has a mission from on high </p>
<p class="i2">   To stop the slaughter of the smiling babe, </p>
<p class="i2">   The pale, crazed mother, weak, defenseless sire, </p>
<p class="i2">   All places on the habitable globe." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Finally to render feasible the ideal development of all peoples, and
put an end to war, America must bring about a league of all nations.
It develops on us&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "To get the races by degrees together </p>
<p class="i2">   To talk their grievance over, in a voice </p>
<p class="i2">   As gentle as a woman's.... </p>
<p class="i2">   There is no education in the world </p>
<p class="i2">   Like human contact for mankind's advance; </p>
<p class="i2">   All differences, then, adjust themselves; </p>
<p class="i2">   But when two races are estranged by hate, </p>
<p class="i2">   They grow so deaf to one another's rights, </p>
<p class="i2">   That it soon comes to pass that either has </p>
<p class="i2">   To use the trumpet of artillery </p>
<p class="i2">   In order to be heard at all." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Recently, Doyle wrote the following lines. Their application is obvious:
</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">   "Vault Godward, Poet. What though few may climb </p>
<p class="i2">   The mountain and the star on trail of thee? </p>
<p class="i2">   Thy wing-flash beams toward man, and if it be </p>
<p class="i2">   True inspiration&mdash;whether thought sublime, </p>
<p class="i2">   Or fervor for the truth, or liberty&mdash; </p>
<p class="i2">   Thy light will reach the earth in goodly time." </p>
</div>
</div>

<p>
What wonder that from so lofty an outlook his searching eye should
pierce the tragedy of "The Jews in Russia"&mdash;or elsewhere&mdash;should pierce
even the revenges that Time would ring in, and rest on a vision of
righteous peace!

<p class="center">
    (<i>From the "Independent," May 30, 1912.</i>)
</p>
<p>
The scene of Mr. Edward Doyle's new play is the Florence of 1400;
the atmosphere that of a plague stricken city in a time when man was
helpless, authorities hopeless, social life in shreds and patches. The
plot of the play founded on this state of affairs is rich in incident,
varied and sufficiently complex in color, passion and character to
furnish material for an exciting spectacular representation. The
tragic element is strong, but supported and shaded by the company of
roysterers, a jester, whose foolery is a compound of bluff of that
period and bluff of modern politics and athletics. The jester, the black
company and the penitents, together with the roysterers, form now the
foreground, now the background, of action, which in itself is never
without the dolorous sound of the death bell. The doomed city is under
a spell comparable to that set forth so vividly in Manzoni's "I Promessi
Sposi." Says the villain of the plot as he listens from his seat at the
festive board:

Pictures like this as sharply defined are frequent and throw in shadowed
blackening on shadow. The author defends the use of a meteorological
phenomenon translated in the spirit of the time as supernatural by
quoting Dante as recognizing it, but the authority of Dante was not
necessary to justify the dramatist in introducing the "Crimson Cross."
It was a part of the pyrotechnics of the church propaganda. Though the
advance of scientific discovery has laid a heavy hand on thaumaturgy
of the sort, it would no doubt, have its use when properly handled
on a modern stage. The action of the drama is rapid and natural, the
characters well drawn and individualized, the dialogue spicy, forceful
and varied.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
